# Genome-scale Algorithms Week 9 â€” exercises

## (1) Discuss Project 3

At the exercises we will discuss the results as described in the project description.

## (2) BWT based pattern matching

Recall the algorithm for exact pattern matching using BWT as presented
in the lecture. In this algorithm we use two tables, O and C, Show how
to compute the C table in time O(*n*) and the O table in time
O(|Sigma| *n*), where *n* is the length of the text and |Sigma| is the
size of the alphabet.
